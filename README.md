# Skip Intro - Proposes to skip an intro automatically

This Kodi add-on shows a Netflix-style notification for skipping the intro in an episode.

## Settings
The add-on has various settings to fine-tune the experience, however the default settings should be fine for most.

  * The default action when nothing is selected
  * The default skip time in seconds.
  * The notification time after which the pop up apears.

> NOTE: The add-on settings are found in the Kodi add-ons section, in the *Services* category.
